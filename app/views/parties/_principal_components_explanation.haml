%p The closer two parties are on the plot, the more often they voted the same way in final bill readings. The distances between the parties is calculated based on their votes. The axis don't have any special meaning, it's the distances between parties that explains similarity in their voting.

%p.faq Is there an explanation for the party clusters?

%p New Zealand First and United Future voted in a similiar way to Labour as they were part of the Labour led government. Both parties had a confidence and supply agreement with Labour. Progressive is not shown as it is almost in exactly the same spot as Labour on the plot.

%p National and Act were relatively similar in their bill voting, but voted quite differently from the other parties.

%p The Greens and Maori party were relatively similar in their bill voting. Both parties' voting differed substantially from both Labour and National. However both the Greens and Māori Party voted more often in the same way as Labour than as National.

%p The plot was created by a statistical analysis of bill votes, using a technique called principal components analysis. The two principal components plotted above explain 74.4% of the variance in the way parties voted on final bill readings.
